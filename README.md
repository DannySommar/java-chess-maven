# JavaFX Chess

A simple chess game built with JavaFX.

---

## Running the Game

Download the latest release JAR and run:

```bash
java -jar javaFX-chess-v1.0.jar
```
## Running from sauce

If I blundered with a .jar release, you can always run the game directly from the project directory:

```bash
mvn javafx:run
```
